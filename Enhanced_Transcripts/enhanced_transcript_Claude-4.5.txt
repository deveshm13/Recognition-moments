## Transcript

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:24]  
To asset transcript generate hoga, ise cheez ko as an input pass karenge apne model pe.  
*(We will generate the asset transcript and pass this thing as input to our model.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:30]  
Aur recognition movement nikaal kar denge. Toh recognition movement—yeh hum kuch aisa feature essence.  
*(And we'll extract the recognition movement. So recognition movement—this is a feature essence we're building.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:36]  
As of now, so today, huh?

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:39]  
Hai.  
*(Yes.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:46]  
Meeting ka organizer hoga.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:51]  
Jayega.  
*(Will go.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:20:56]  
And this basis pe, hum usko batayenge usmein yeh likha hoga, ki…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:22:21]  
Okay, there is, ah…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:22:23]  
Was like the database, um…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:22:25]  
Meeting chali, ho sakta hai Devesh company ka, dusri company ka user ho.  
*(The meeting happened, Devesh could be from the same company or from another company's user.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:22:34]  
Appreciate kar sakte hain.  
*(Can appreciate.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:22:38]

*(And, uh, yeah, so like mine, and discussion with a—all these meetings.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:15]  
Jo sab, sorry, meetings?

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:17]  
Kisi, all language mein ho rahe ho, English mein nahi ho.  
*(In any language they're happening, not in English.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:23:19]  
Matlab yaani ki, uh, just have a—is the transcript data multilingual?

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:34]  
We're told to explore whether it gets Google mein bhi, toh hai kya?  
*(We're told to explore whether it's also in Google or not.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:23:39]  
Mm-hmm.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:41]  
So, um, both are, yeh scenarios ho sakte hain. Hame yeh saari scenarios ko apne…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:47]  
Process mein handle karna hai.  
*(In our process.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:50]

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:23:54]  
Meeting mein.  
*(In the meeting.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:03]  
And, uh, kayi baar meeting se kabhi bhi, heated hoti hain, haan.  
*(And, many times meetings can get heated, yes.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:06]  
Those mein recognition moment nahi milega.  
*(In those we won't get recognition moments.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:17]  
Toh prepare karna hai?  
*(So we need to prepare?)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:19]  
Jo prompt is meeting transcript ko, hum kisi AWS Bedrock model ko bhejenge.  
*(The prompt that we send this meeting transcript to any AWS Bedrock model.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:25]  
Recognition movement.

**Devesh Mishra** [13:24:33]  
So, mainly, I'll be, uh…

**Devesh Mishra** [13:24:37]  
Best model choose karenge. Usmein, this LLM toh hai hi doosra?  
*(Will choose the best model. In that, this LLM is there, what else?)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:24:45]  
Aur? Recognition moments nikalne ke liye.  
*(And? To extract recognition moments.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:24:52]

Mm-hmm.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:26:26]  
Detail aspect se sochenge. Abhi hum us pe hi jaa rahe hain.  
*(We'll think from a detailed aspect. Right now we're going towards that.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:26:41]  
Um, manually do ya teen model ko test karte hain, un mein se best model jo hume samajh mein aata hai.

Mention hai.  
*(It's mentioned.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:30:52]  
Then, our model should…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:30:54]  
100% give the correct reasons.

**Devesh Mishra** [13:30:58]  
But transcript ko improve kar paenge agar mera need padi toh… Matlab Peru mein… You know, the agents ko use kar, transcripts ko sahi karna, aap mujhse nahi se aapse hai.  
*(But we can improve the transcript if my need arises… I mean in Peru… You know, using the agents, to correct the transcripts, it's not from me but from you.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:31:09]  
Huh, yeah, we got your idea, correct.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:31:12]

*(Of challenges… will have to do.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:32:44]  
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We can discuss, okay.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:32:51]  
Kar na paoge?  
*(Won't you be able to do it?)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:32:54]  
Nahi toh…  
*(Otherwise…)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:32:59]  
Azure pe hi solution.  
*(Solution on Azure itself.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:33:05]

*(Finalize the neighbor model, for its testing we can use our own O.C. Tanner company where meetings happen, some of their…)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:33:24]  
Transcript nikaal lenge. Yeh file ke transcript regenerate kar lenge.  
*(We'll extract transcripts. We'll regenerate transcripts for these files.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:33:31]  
Pandrah-bees case ke, transcript generate karenge.  
*(We'll generate transcripts for fifteen-twenty cases.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:33:36]  
How separate? Multilingual aur bhi thoda sahi kar paenge. And the Hyderabad, you said that, or… Agar local language mein open meetings na milti hain grain.  
*(How separate? We can also do multilingual a bit better. And the Hyderabad, you said that, or… If we don't get open meetings in local language.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:33:46]  
Oh, haan, obviously.  
*(Oh, yes, obviously.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:33:49]  
So, wo bhi multilingual toh hoga, usmein use kar rahe hain, I think.  
*(So, that will also be multilingual, we're using it, I think.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:33:56]

*(Provides transcript.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:34:11]  
Wohi toh. Jaise, yeh jo meet hamari chal rahi hai, toh humlog Hindi mein baat kar rahe hain, baat ko English mein… wo sab Hinglish hi hota hai, wo kar deta hai.  
*(That's exactly it. Like, this meeting we're having, we're speaking in Hindi, the conversation in English… all that is Hinglish, it does that.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:34:20]  
So, woh toh se atleast.  
*(So, at least that.)*

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:34:23]  
Mm-hmm.

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:34:36]  
Actually, pehle kam, yeh. Jis mamla mein requirement hai usko…  
*(Actually, less work, this. The matter in which there's a requirement, that…)*

Haan, Kevin ne document toh kar diya.  
*(Yes, Kevin made the document.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:34:45]  
We'll probably hold the argumentative…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:34:51]  
Mm-hmm.

**Devesh Mishra** [13:34:52]  
MCP server still takes these material or baaki toh ho gaya support.  
*(MCP server still takes these materials or the rest has been supported.)*

**Devesh Mishra** [13:34:58]  
I think…

**Saurabh Mishra** [13:34:58]

## Meeting Summary

**Topic:** Discussion about implementing a Recognition Movement feature using AI/ML models

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Feature Overview:** Building a recognition movement feature that processes meeting transcripts to identify moments where team members should be recognized for their contributions

2. **Technical Approach:**
   - Using AWS Bedrock models to process meeting transcripts
   - Testing multiple models including GPT, Copilot, Llama, and DeepSeek
   - Preparing prompts for optimal recognition moment extraction

3. **Challenges Identified:**
   - Multilingual support (meetings in Hindi, English, Hinglish, and other languages)
   - Professional vs. non-professional meeting contexts
   - Transcript quality and accuracy
   - Cross-company user recognition
   - Avoiding hallucinations in model output

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Select best model for POC
   - Create proper prompts with examples
   - Test with 15-20 real meeting transcripts from O.C. Tanner
   - Document recognition moment definitions
   - Handle various meeting types (HR, IT, client discussions, etc.)

**Action Items:**
- Devesh to explore model loading and console usage
- Document recognition movement definitions
- Prepare use cases for testing
- Generate test transcripts from company meetings
