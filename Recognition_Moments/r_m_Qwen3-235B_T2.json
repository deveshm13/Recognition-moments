The results are very strong. We're seeing a 9% lift in NDCG and a 12% lift in MAP@k compared to the existing system. This indicates a significant improvement in the quality and ranking of recommendations.",

For the cold start issue, I borrowed logic from our old 'Content Similarity Engine' and used `Doc2Vec` embeddings to recommend new items based on textual similarity. For the latency, I implemented a FAISS index, a technique we used in the 'Ad-Targeting' project, to speed up the vector search from 300ms down to 20ms.",

When the recommendation component loaded, the sudden appearance of the new items caused a noticeable 'layout shift' on the page, which is jarring for the user. To fix this, I implemented a content placeholder strategy. The component now renders a skeleton UI that matches the final layout, which is then smoothly replaced by the actual product cards once the data arrives from the API. This has made the loading experience much cleaner.",
