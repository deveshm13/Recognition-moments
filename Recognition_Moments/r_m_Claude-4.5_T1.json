The outcome is a production-ready recommendation engine with 9% NDCG lift and latency within SLA (110ms vs 150ms target).",

The progression from a shadow model to an internal release and then a controlled A/B test is perfect. Your ownership of this project, from conception to the details of the deployment, has been absolutely outstanding. This is precisely the standard of excellence we strive for. I will be highlighting this work in my next director-level review, and I'm submitting this for a 'Spotlight Award' for technical achievement.",
