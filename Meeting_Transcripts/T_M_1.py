I'm Sarah Mitchell, Product Manager for Culture Cloud, and I'm really excited to walk you through some of our newest features that we believe will significantly enhance employee engagement on your platform. With me today are James Rodriguez, our Senior Solutions Consultant, and Emma Thompson from Customer Success. Before we dive in, could our colleagues from GlobalTech quickly introduce themselves?"

With me are Rachel Patel, our HR Director, and David Williams, who leads our Employee Experience initiatives. We're really looking forward to seeing what you've built. Employee engagement has been a key focus area for us this quarter."

          "text": "Excellent. So today we're going to cover eight new features that we've launched. The first one I want to highlight is called \"Say Thanks.\" This feature is particularly powerful because it gives your customers—in your case, GlobalTech's clients—a direct voice in recognition. Essentially, customers can show appreciation to your employees through a simple link or QR code. Let me show you how this works in practice."

          "text": "I'll take over the demo here, Sarah. So what you're seeing on screen is how a customer interaction would work. Imagine one of GlobalTech's clients has just received exceptional service from one of your support team members. They can scan a QR code or click a link, and they're taken to this simple form where they can leave a thank you message. That recognition goes directly into your Culture Cloud platform and becomes visible to the employee, their manager, and can be shared across the organization."

          "text": "Great question, Michael. While it's designed primarily for customer-to-employee recognition, the architecture is flexible. You could technically generate QR codes for any external stakeholder—suppliers, partners, even community members if you're involved in community outreach programs. The system tracks the source of the recognition, so you can measure different types of external appreciation."

          "text": "I really like that. One challenge we've had is that our customer service teams sometimes feel disconnected from the impact they're making. This direct line from customers could be transformative. What kind of analytics do we get around this?"

          "text": "Rachel, I'm glad you asked. Let me jump in here. The analytics dashboard shows you recognition trends by department, individual employees, customer sentiment, and frequency. You can see which teams are receiving the most customer kudos, which can inform everything from performance reviews to identifying best practices. We've seen organizations using this data for coaching and development as well."

          "text": "Exactly. And our research shows that customer recognition increases engagement by ten times. Now, let me move to the next feature—\"Post a Win.\" This is all about peer-to-peer celebration. David, I think this might be particularly relevant for your employee experience strategy."

          "text": "Post a Win allows employees to share accomplishments, photos, and stories across the organization. Think of it as a social feed, but specifically for celebrating victories—big or small. Let me show you what this looks like. Here's an example post where an engineering team completed a major project milestone. They've added photos from their celebration, tagged team members, and you can see colleagues commenting and reacting."

          "text": "What makes this powerful is the visibility. Our data shows that 70% of employees haven't been recognized in the last 30 days. Post a Win democratizes recognition and creates a continuous stream of positive moments. It keeps great work visible and creates a culture of appreciation that doesn't rely solely on top-down recognition."

          "text": "Yes, absolutely. You have full control over moderation settings. You can choose to have posts auto-publish, require manager approval, or have HR review before they go live. We recommend starting with auto-publish for most organizations because it maintains the spontaneity and authenticity, but we understand some industries have stricter requirements."

          "text": "That's completely doable. You can set different rules by department, location, or any other organizational hierarchy. Now, the next feature builds on Post a Win—it's called \"Broadcast.\" This gives leaders the ability to amplify meaningful recognition. When leaders spot something exceptional, they can broadcast it to teams, departments, or the entire organization."

          "text": "Let me demonstrate this. Here's a Post a Win from earlier. As a leader, I can click \"Broadcast\" and choose my audience. Let's say I want to share this with the entire Asia-Pacific region. I can add my own message of endorsement, and now thousands of employees will see this recognition moment. This creates what we call cascading recognition—one moment of appreciation becomes a company-wide celebration."

          "text": "Absolutely, Rachel. We have a full leadership dashboard that shows you which leaders are broadcasting, how frequently, and the engagement those broadcasts receive. You can use this data in leadership development programs or even tie it to leadership performance metrics if that aligns with your strategy."

          "text": "Another feature that pairs well with Broadcast is \"Boost.\" This allows anyone—leaders or peers—to add additional points or praise to an existing recognition. If someone receives a thank you, others can boost it, which amplifies the impact and creates momentum. Let me show you how this works."

          "text": "Here's an example. An employee received customer recognition through Say Thanks. Her manager saw it and boosted it with additional points and a personal message. Then colleagues added their own boosts. What started as a single recognition moment became a wave of support. Research shows that when people are invited to recognize others, they're more likely to feel hope and connection at work."

          "text": "Yes, you can set boost limits by role. For example, managers might be able to boost up to 500 points, while peers might have a 100-point limit. You have complete control over the economics. Now, let me shift to some features specifically designed for your deskless workforce—and Rachel, I know this was top of mind for you."

          "participant": { "id": "sarah-mitchell-id", "displayName": "Sarah Mitchell" },
          "text": "This is exactly why we built \"Manager Store.\" Eighty percent of the global workforce is deskless, and traditional digital recognition often doesn't reach them effectively. Manager Store is an online storefront where managers can order physical recognition items—pins, certificates, collectibles, awards—all branded and ready to hand directly to employees."

          "text": "Let me walk you through the interface. Managers log in, browse the catalog, and place orders. Items ship directly to the manager or the location, and they can present them in person. This solves the tangible recognition gap for employees who aren't on computers every day. Everything is tracked in the system, so you still get your analytics and reporting."

          "text": "You can allocate budgets by manager, by location, or by department. Managers see their available budget in real-time, and they can't exceed it. You can also require approval for orders over certain amounts. It's designed to give managers autonomy while maintaining financial control."

          "text": "Related to this is \"Company Store\"—and this is about building culture through branded merchandise. Employees can use points to get company-branded gear: hats, sweatshirts, water bottles, whatever represents your brand. It's more than merchandise; it's about creating identity and belonging."

Here's a client who has five different stores: a wellness store with fitness equipment and healthy living items, a safety store with recognition tied to safety milestones, a sales incentive store, an onboarding store for new hires, and their main company store. Each runs on its own budget and point bank. This makes recognition more targeted and effective because it aligns with specific business objectives."

The longest lead time is typically for Manager Store and Company Store because we need to work with you on product selection, branding, and supplier setup. But features like Say Thanks, Post a Win, Broadcast, and Boost could be live within two weeks after we finalize your configuration preferences."

Would you like us to schedule a separate deep dive on LSAs?"
